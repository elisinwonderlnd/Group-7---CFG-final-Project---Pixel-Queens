            </h2>
            <p class="text-container">
                We are excited to introduce you to <b>Pixel Queens</b>, an online blog created by a team of passionate
                gamers and aspiring web developers. This project was born out of our shared love for video games and the
                skills we developed during the <b>Web Development Kickstarter class</b> by <a
                    href="https://codefirstgirls.com/">Code First Girls</a>. Over eight weeks, we immersed ourselves in
                learning the fundamentals of <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, and <b>frameworks</b>, and then
                brought those lessons to life by building this website from scratch.

                The idea for <b>Pixel Queens</b> came about when we realized we all wanted to create something
                meaningful and fun that reflected our interests. After brainstorming, we settled on a gaming magazine
                that would offer a unique perspective on the gaming world, featuring reviews, news, and articles written
                by gamers for gamers. With this goal in mind, we set out to create a site that would be both visually
                appealing and easy to navigate, designed to offer an engaging experience for all visitors. We hope you
                enjoy exploring <b>Pixel Queens</b> as much as we enjoyed creating it!

                        our background and out passions so we can find something in common tobase our project off!
                        Also, if you've got any ideas, feel free to write them down. What do you think?

                        I agree! Videogames seems a good topic to talk about!
                        I feel like creating a game from scratch could be too complicated,
                        but maybe we can redesign a website that sells them (like Steam), or maybe do a magazine about
                        them!

                different parts of the world, united by a shared passion for gaming and web development. Each of us

                <li><b>Elisa Marra</b> - Designed the wireframe and overall concept as the UI/UX designer. Integrated
                    HTML and CSS files, ensured all links were functional, and alt text was included for accessibility.
                    Assisted in resolving code issues.</li>

            <p class="text-container">
                Designing <b>Pixel Queens</b> was a creative journey inspired by our favorite websites and our vision
                for a gaming magazine that stands out. We began by researching various sites, analyzing their layouts,
                color schemes, and user interfaces to gather ideas. Websites like <a
                    href="https://abstract-intelligence.com/">Abstract Intelligence</a> and <a
                    href="https://pokemonhistory.tilda.ws/en">Pokemon History</a> provided valuable insights into
                effective design elements, which we adapted to suit our vision. We created sketches and wireframes to
                plan the website’s structure and flow, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience.

                Accessibility was a top priority from the beginning. We chose the <a
                    href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Atkinson+Hyperlegible">Atkinson Hyperlegible</a> font for
                its readability, especially for users with visual impairments, and incorporated a high-contrast color
                palette to enhance visibility. The colors used — <b>purple (#A1A0EE)</b>, <b>white (#D9D9D9)</b>,
                <b>pink (#FF4D80)</b>, and <b>black (#373131)</b> — were selected to balance aesthetics with
                accessibility. We also included alt text for all images and adhered to best practices in UI/UX design to
                make the website as inclusive as possible.

            <p class="text-container">
                The coding phase of <b>Pixel Queens</b> was both challenging and rewarding. We faced various obstacles,
                such as coordinating our efforts across different time zones and learning how to share code efficiently.
                Initially, we relied on <b>Google Drive</b> for collaboration, but this approach proved less effective.
                We have now learned to use <b>GitHub</b> for better version control and smoother teamwork. We also
                encountered specific issues with the <b>Bootstrap</b> framework, particularly in designing the navbar
                and footer, and struggled with implementing full responsiveness due to time constraints.

                Despite these challenges, we successfully brought our vision to life using a blend of <b>HTML</b> (78.8%
                for the website's basic structure), <b>CSS</b> (16.6% for styling elements like buttons and images), and
                <b>JavaScript</b> (4.6% for dynamic features, such as the moving background, "return to top" button, and
                marquee text). Through determination and teamwork, we overcame each hurdle, and we are proud of the
                final result: a functional, visually appealing website that reflects our passion for gaming and web
                development.
