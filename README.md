# Pixel Queens

Welcome to **Pixel Queens**! This is a personal project created by a group of four passionate gamers and budding web developers as part of our final project for the **Web Development Course** by [Code First Girls](https://codefirstgirls.com/).

## About the Project

**Pixel Queens** is an online magazine dedicated to our favourite games. The website features a homepage and a main article page, designed to provide an engaging and accessible experience for gamers around the world.

## Team Members

This project was developed by **Group 7**, consisting of:

- **Boglarka Ser** - *Responsible for creating the basic CSS file and setting up corresponding classes in the HTML. Developed the JavaScript functionalities and contributed to fixing the navbar and footer sections.*
- **Elisa Marra** - *Designed the wireframe and overall concept as the UI/UX designer. Integrated HTML and CSS files, ensured all links were functional, and alt text was included for accessibility. Assisted in resolving code issues.*
- **Rita Shaibu** - *Responsible for creating the basic HTML file.*  
- **Viktoryia Yerashenka** - *Contributed to setting up the navbar and footer sections using Bootstrap.*

  ## Technical Details

- **Responsiveness:** Please note that this website is currently **not fully responsive** for all devices and screen sizes. We are actively working on improving its responsiveness to enhance the user experience on different devices.
- **Bootstrap Integration:** We used **Bootstrap** to create the navbar and footer for a consistent and modern look across the website. The integration helped simplify the design process and maintain a clean and professional appearance.
